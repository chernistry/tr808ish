# CR-717 Drum Machine - Project Description
## Project Goal

Create drum machine.


## Backlog
- Read tickets under `backlog/open/` sorted by prefix `nn-` and dependency order.

Operating rules:
- Always consult architecture and coding rules first.
- Execute backlog tasks by dependency order.
- Write reliable, production-quality code with micro tests.
- Respect formatters, linters, and conventions.
- Update/clarify specs before changes if required.
- No chain‑of‑thought disclosure; provide final results + brief rationale.
 - Keep diffs focused; refactor only what's touched unless fixing clear bad practice.

Per‑task process:
1) Read the task → outline a short plan → confirm.
2) Change the necessary surface area to ensure robust implementation.
3) Add/update tests and run local checks.
4) Stable commit with a clear message.

For significant choices:
- Use a lightweight MCDM: define criteria and weights; score alternatives; pick highest; record rationale.

Output:
- Brief summary of what changed.
- Files/diffs, tests, and run instructions (if needed).
- Notes on inconsistencies and proposed spec updates.

Quality Gates (must pass)
- Build succeeds; no type errors.
- Lint/format clean.
- Tests green (unit/integration; E2E/perf as applicable).
- Security checks: no secrets in code/logs; input validation present.
- Performance/observability budgets met (if defined).

Git Hygiene
- Branch: `feat/<ticket-id>-<slug>`.
- Commits: Conventional Commits; imperative; ≤72 chars.
- Reference the ticket in commit/PR.

Stop Rules
- Conflicts with architecture/coding rules.
- Missing critical secrets/inputs that would risk mis‑implementation.
- Required external dependency is down or license‑incompatible (document evidence).
- Violates security/compliance constraints.

Quota Awareness (optional)
- Document relevant API quotas and backoff strategies; prefer batch operations.
