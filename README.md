# tr808ish

![TR-808 Synth Screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

A simple drum sequencer created with AI in about half an hour, inspired by the classic TR-808 but not pretending to replicate the original. Use it freely in your projects!

This project demonstrates the SDD (Spec-Driven Development) approach - a methodology for rapid development using AI agents with structured prompts and templates. For more details on SDD, check out [SDDRush](https://github.com/chernistry/SDDRush).

All prompts used in this project are available in both locations - the SDDRush repo and the sdd directory within this project.
